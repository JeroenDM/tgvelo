Where did we get the existing knowledge?
Collection of relevant measurable parameters of an (electric) bicycle.
Oranizing many different parameters in four subgroups.
Categories based on user needs.

# New concepts

## Typical parameters, in a different way
Gears: trap50 trap70, or speed @50 rpm and speed @70 rpm.
Battery: net available energy.
Electic assistance: design speed.

## Additional new paramteres
*Usability*: what is important when using the bike every day.

# Proven in practice

Extensive testing for some of the project partners.
The paramters prove to be distinctive.

Net available energy
TGVelo sizing system
Useability: kickstand, shimmy, motor constrol
Reliability: mounting
Safety: visibility
